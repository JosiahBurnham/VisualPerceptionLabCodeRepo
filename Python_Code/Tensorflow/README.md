## Directory for raw tensorflow

This is mostly just legacy code from one of DiMattina's old papers, and some code before we switched to Keras. There is really no good reason to soley use tensorflow anymore but if you have to I'm sorry.


I really didn't filter through any of this, I basically just pushed all the really old code that I had to this repository. So there are some shell scripts in here to that we use for the HPC cluster at FGCU
